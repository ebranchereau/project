# Tic Tac Toe Project
Made by **Markus Lindell** and **Elias Branchereau**. It is a simple TicTacToe game in which you can play in **Pass & Play** or against the **computer**. We have the choice between random placements and the best placement by the computer.


## Editing Js or Ts files.

To edit the Js/Ts files you have to edit the Ts files and `tsc [filename]`, then remove the second line of the newly created or edited **Js file**.
